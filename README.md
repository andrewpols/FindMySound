# FindMySound

## About
**FindMySound** is a React-based web application that connects to a user's Spotify account to recommend new music.

The app helps users discover tracks outside of their regular algorithmic suggestions by analyzing their Spotify listening habits and generating fresh recommendations.

Features include:
- Secure Spotify login via OAuth
- Track recommendations based on top artists or genres
- Direct links to preview or open tracks in Spotify
- Option to save discovered songs to your own playlist

## Installation
- Clone this repository:

      git clone https://github.com/andrewpols/FindMySound

- Navigate into the project directory and install dependencies:

      cd FindMySound
      npm install

- Navigate to `FindMySound/config/.env` and input your Spotify Web API credentials (required).

To obtain your Spotify API credentials, youâ€™ll need to register an application at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/.

## Running the Application
### Backend:
The Django backend first needs some configuration:

### Database Setup

This project uses SQLite by default. The `db.sqlite3` file is not included in the repository, so you'll need to initialize a fresh database.

To do this, navigate to the root directory and run:

    python manage.py migrate

Then, you may create a superuser with:
    
    python manage.py createsuperuser

Finally, start the backend server by running:

    python manage.py runserver

### Frontend:
Start the development server (React + Vite) with:

    npm run dev

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage
On launch, the app will prompt you to log in with Spotify.

After authentication:
- View and toggle your Spotify playlists for recommendation
- View personalized music recommendations
- Upload playlist recommendations to your Spotify account
